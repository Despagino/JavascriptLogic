# JavascriptPractice

Here you will see my Javascript logic. I have compiled Javascript exercises in this reposiory, including my "Paragraph Checker" file. 
My paragraph checker will be an ongoing project of mine that will include check paragraphs if it will be valid according to whatever requirements you set. 

The outcome of this project will be:

-  Check if your paragraph has no spelling errors
-  How many characters that paragraph has
-  Define words that you don't know
-  Create your essay inn this app for more organized and efficient way of creating essays
